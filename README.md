## Project Experience
**MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT - CUSTOMER PROPENSITY TO PURCHASE**
- Conducted customer segmentation on 600k+ records using K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), achieving high silhouette scores (0.84–0.89) for well-separated clusters.
-	Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer purchase likelihood, achieving AUC > 0.93, supporting targeted marketing strategies.
-	Developed a Gradient Boosting Regression model to generate continuous propensity scores, reducing RMSE to 0.0208 for accurate customer ranking.
-	Delivered actionable business insights for personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and reactivation campaigns, enhancing customer engagement and retention strategies.

**FLIGHT DELAY PREDICTION & ANALYSIS USING STATISTICAL MODELS**
-	Analysed 46M+ U.S. flight records (1988–2007) to uncover patterns in delays and diversions.
-	Applied SQL and Python/R for data preparation, wrangling, and visualization of delay patterns by day and time.
-	Built and evaluated logistic regression models to predict diverted flights with metrics like accuracy, recall, and AUC.
-	Investigated aircraft age impact on delays, highlighting operational challenges with older planes.
